Machine Learning
- Grew out of work in AI
- New capability for computers

Examples:
- DB mining
- Applications can't program by hand
- Self-customizing programss

## What is Machine Learning?
Two definations offered:
- Arthur Samuel described it as: "the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." This is an older, informal definition.
- Tom Mitchell provides a more modern definition: "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."

Machine Leanring Algorithms:
- supervised learning
- unsupervised learning
- Others: Reinforcement learning, recommender systems


## Supervised Learning
- Provide a dataset with a "right answer" (key idea)
- Regression: predict continuous valued output
- Classification problem: discrete value output(0 or 1?)
- Support Vector Machine: allow the machine to deal with infinite number of features
- Two main categories
	- Regression: predict results within a continuous output
	- Classification: predict results in a dis crete output

## Unsupervised Learning
- Clustering problem: given the data with no labels, try to find the pattern inside
- Non-clustering problem: given some data "mixed together", try to classify them out (example: "Cocktail Party Algorithmx")
